* Running Sum Of 1D Array 

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [3, 3+1, 3+1+2, 3+1+2+10, 3+1+2+10+1].
