* Running Sum Of 1D Array 

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [3, 3+1, 3+1+2, 3+1+2+10, 3+1+2+10+1].

* Shuffle the Array 

Given an array nums, nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].

Return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1], n = 4
Output: [1,4,2,3,3,2,4,1]
